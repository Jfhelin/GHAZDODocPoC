title: GHAzDO Product Updates
---

#  🔐 CONFIDENTIAL 🔐 - Internal docs
 - [GHAzDO Roadmap 🔐](https://aka.ms/ghazdo-roadmap)

# Product Update from 1/25

## Big Goal - get GHAZDO on more repos in pilots
-  Good feedback but limited scope and demo repos
- Want to know just not working in small scale tests

## Secret scanning
- Way it works in github is how it will work in ADO - just relies on what is in repo
- Push protection stringent but history scanning can be more broad
- Limitations
   - Size (Ex: ISO Files)
   - Wont unpack zips
      - Encoding support? - too easy to get around but some do base 64
	
## API enablement
- Will light up integration with DfD
- power BI as a stop gap
- Would enable SIEM export e.g. to splunk 

## Alert UX 
-  Code Scanning + Secret scanning coming to the Advanced Security view!

## Permissions to View and Dismiss findings will be explicitly added
- ACL … (NOT RBAC)
