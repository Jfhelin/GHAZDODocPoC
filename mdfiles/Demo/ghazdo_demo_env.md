title: GHAZDO Demo Environment
---


To create a GHAzDO demo in AzDO, follow these steps:

## Initial Access (one time only)
1. Create an issue in `octodemo-resources/azure-devops-onboarding`: [Access Request](https://github.com/octodemo-resources/azure-devops-onboarding/issues/new/choose) 
1. Wait for the Access Request issue to be closed 
   - You need to be onboarded to the Azure DevOps organization first before requesting a GHAzDO demo, otherwise your user account does not exist, and the permissions for you to access it will not succeed.

## Provision Demo

1. Create an issue in `octodemo/bootstrap`: [Create GHAzDO v1 Demo](https://github.com/octodemo/bootstrap/issues/new?assignees=octodemobot&labels=demo%2Ctemplate%2Ctmpl%3Aoctodemo-resources%2Ftmpl_ghazdo_v1&template=ghazdo_v1.yml&title=Demo+Creation+%3A%3A+ghazdo_v1)
   - Put in the name of the repo. 
   - Create this issue. 
   - Wait for the completed comment on the issue that will provide a link to your personal demo repo
