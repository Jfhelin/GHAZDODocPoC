## Product Support Escalation

Support Escalation Process
Based on GitHub's GHAS code scanning support escalation volume, GitHub does not anticipate heavy support volume for GHAzDO users. Nevertheless, we are putting a plan in place to handle escalations.

Support escalations from GHAzDO CodeQL users will follow a defined escalation path:
- Level 1 support: Microsoft Azure DevOps support team
   - Tickets: Service Tree Offering ID in IcM is 50549a7d-743c-404e-9383-156bd3fe4457 (must use @microsoft.com credentials)
- Level 2 support: Microsoft GHAzDO engineering team
   - Tickets: Microsoft Azure DevOps with backlog: https://mseng.visualstudio.com/1ES/_backlogs/backlog/ADO-AS/Epics 
- Level 3 support: GitHub CodeQL engineering team
   - Tickets: https://github.com/github/code-scanning/issues/new/choose and select “GHAS for Azure DevOps support escalation”

Therefore, our process serves Level 2 support escalation to Level 3:

- Create a new issue in the github/code-scanning repo under type [GHAS for Azure DevOps support escalation](https://github.com/github/code-scanning/issues/new?assignees=&labels=support-escalation%2CGHAzDO&template=1-2-GHAzDo-support-escalation.md&title=)
  - Request support or file a bug report that relates to GHAS on Azure DevOps
  - leverages a sev1/2/3 support escalation template and SLA
