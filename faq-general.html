  <tbody>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">Is GHAS on GitHub the same as GHAzDO?</td>
  <td align="left">Similar paradigms are guiding development with small differences but we are working towards feature parity.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">Will there be a public roadmap available</td>
  <td align="left">Public Roadmap is coming but TBD, Private Roadmap available here  (internal and private preview access only).   Internal roadmap working document - <a href="https://aka.ms/ghazdo-roadmap" rel="nofollow">https://aka.ms/ghazdo-roadmap</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">Can GHAzDO analyze/protect GitHub repos?</td>
  <td align="left">Must be Git repos in AzDO.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">Will GHAzDO be available to Azure Devops Server or TFVC?</td>
  <td align="left">The customer must be on AzDO cloud. GHAzDO does not work with Azure DevOps Server or TFVC. Must be Git repos in AzDO.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">Is there a way to see Secret Scanning repo scanning results and Code Scanning results other than by viewing the build log output?</td>
  <td align="left">The functionality to view Secret Scanning and Code Scanning results in a more robust experience, like Dependency Scanning, will appear in an upcoming update.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">How can I dismiss an alert, or mark it “won’t fix” or “false positive,” etc.?</td>
  <td align="left">This functionality will appear in an upcoming update.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">Do we need to file for an exception while there is no dismiss alert action?</td>
  <td align="left">No, none of the alerts or findings will be build-blocking.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">How can I assign an alert to a specific person to investigate or fix?</td>
  <td align="left">We recommend that you manually create a work item with the necessary details.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">Will enabling any of the tasks prevent teams from building or otherwise include a gating function?</td>
  <td align="left">No, enabling a task will simply surface findings in the build log and alert UI in the case of dependency scanning but none of these will block deployments.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">I have specific languages or infrastructure set up that I don't think is covered. Can I still participate in trying out GHAS for ADO?</td>
  <td align="left">Dependency scanning and code scanning are language-dependent, however secret scanning is language agnostic and will still be able to detect secrets.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">What tasks require a build</td>
  <td align="left">-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">What tasks require Publish security results</td>
  <td align="left">-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">What is the Publish step doing?</td>
  <td align="left">Displays warning or secrets by codescanning or secret tasks.  This will have a bunch of debug output but will responsible for displaying results in that step instead of each individual task!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">How long does it take for runtimes</td>
  <td align="left">Depends on size of repo</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td align="left">Will GHAZDO integrate into test plans to show compliance over time?</td>
  <td align="left">No plans currently for this.</td>
